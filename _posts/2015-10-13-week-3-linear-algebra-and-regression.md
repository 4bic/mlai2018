Linear Algebra and Regression
=============================

For this week the lecture slides are available
[here](./assets/w3_regression.pdf).

### YouTube Video

There is a YouTube video available of me giving this material at the
[Gaussian Process Road Show in Uganda](http://gpss.cc/gprs13/). You
will need to watch this in HD to make the maths clearer.

Lab Class
---------

Linear regression with numpy and Python.

The notebook for the lab class can be downloaded from
[here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/lawrennd/mlai2015/blob/master/week3.ipynb).

To obtain the lab class in ipython notebook, first open the ipython
notebook. Then paste the following code into the ipython notebook

    import urllib.request
    urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawrennd/mlai2015/master/week3.ipynb', 'week3.ipynb')

You should now be able to find the lab class by clicking `File->Open` on
the ipython notebook menu.
