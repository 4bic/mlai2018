Prerequisites
-------------

For this course we assume that you have seen linear algebra before as well as probability and calculus. The course is in Python, but we will not be 'teaching' the language. The assumption is that you have enough prior experience of programming to pick up the language as you go. If you are unfamiliar with these concepts you might want to refresh yourself with [this lab class](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/lawrennd/mlai2014/blob/master/lab_classes/machines_and_intelligence/MI_Lab_class.ipynb) on basic machine learning in python with the notebook.

Recommended text books
----------------------

The main course recommended text is [Rogers and Girolami's "A First Course in Machine Learning"](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~srogers/firstcourseml/). Also useful is [Bishop, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/). Most lectures will provide references to these text, and it will help a lot if you read the relevant sections in your own time.

A further publicly available text is [Hastie et. al, The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/).

Pre-requisites
--------------

You are expected to have familiarity with basic probability and linear algebra. We will use Python and the ipython notebook on the course, so you are expected to be comfortable with adapting to a new programming environment without specific tuition.
